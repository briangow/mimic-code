  Currently MIMIC-IV is not available on AWS, but it is planned.

<!-- 

Recently, the MIT Laboratory of Computational Physiology (LCP) started hosting the MIMIC-IV dataset on the AWS cloud through the AWS Public Dataset program. You can now use the MIMIC-IV dataset via S3 without having to download, copy, or pay to store it. Instead, you can analyze the MIMIC-IV dataset in the AWS Cloud using AWS services like Amazon EC2, Athena, AWS Lambda, or Amazon EMR. AWS Cloud availability enables quicker and cheaper research into the dataset.

Services like Athena also offer you new analytical approaches to the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using Athena, you can execute standard SQL queries against MIMIC-IV without first loading the data into a database. Because you can reference the MIMIC-IV dataset hosted by MIT LCP in Amazon S3, your analyses always reference the most recent version of the MIMIC-IV dataset. Live hosting reduces upfront time and effort, eliminates data synchronization issues, improves data analysis, and reduces overall study costs.

Once you have successfully requested access to MIMIC-IV on AWS, you can follow the instructions linked below. These instructions initialize and execute an entire study performed on MIMIC-IV using a hosted Jupyter notebook service on AWS.
